# Coursey
Online course platform where user can buy an online course. This project implemented RBAC (Role Based Access Control) using Spatie which has 3 roles: Owner, Teacher, Student and each role have their own protected routes. The authentication feature implemented using Breeze library.

## Features

### 1. Owner Role can manage all courses
Owner can add or remove course

### 2. Teacher Role can add or remove its own course
Teacher can manage course inluding the price. Add video for each lesson

### 3. Student Role can buy course and learn
After buying a course, student can learning through the course

## Future Plan
- Add payment integration because right now student can only buy a course by uploading transfer receipt via form and still need manual confirmation by admin.
